# Arduino weather station
The goal is to create a weather display on the arduino platform. Initially, weather data will be retrieved from weather stations https://tie.digitraffic.fi/api/v3/metadata/weather-stations.

There are plans to develop a way to select displayed weather information from a list of several places.
